*****MONITORING AN APPLICATION USING PROMETHEUS*****
Information can be found in project2aws
Use case: See how many times localhost:8091/users/getUsers is invoked 
Steps:
1.) We will need to include actuator dependency which will expose the health/metrics of the application
	When you add actuator dependency you will automatically get micrometer
		Micrometer helps take measurements of your application
		It's also responsible for collecting the metrics of your application and then publishing those metrics to prometheus
You need to add the actuator dependency in the pom.xml file if it's not there already
2.) We want to add another dependency, micrometer-registry-prometheus
	This allows you to register micrometer with prometheus
3.) After adding dependencies always make sure to Maven reload your project
4.) Next you have to expose the endpoints(endpoints of what though?)
	Achieve this by going to application.properties and writing
	management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,prometheus
	OR
	management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
