*****MONITORING AN APPLICATION USING PROMETHEUS*****
Information can be found in project2aws
Use case: See how many times localhost:8091/users/getUsers is invoked 
Steps:
1.) Adding dependency
	We will need to include actuator dependency which will expose the health/metrics of the application
	When you add actuator dependency you will automatically get micrometer
		Micrometer helps take measurements of your application
		It's also responsible for collecting the metrics of your application and then publishing those metrics to prometheus
You need to add the actuator dependency in the pom.xml file if it's not there already
2.) Adding dependency
	We want to add another dependency, micrometer-registry-prometheus
	This allows you to register micrometer with prometheus
3.) Maven reload project
	After adding dependencies always make sure to Maven reload your project
4.) Exposing endpoints
	Next you have to expose the endpoints of health, info, and prometheus
	Achieve this by going to application.properties and writing
	management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,prometheus
	OR
	management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
5.) Configure in prometheus
