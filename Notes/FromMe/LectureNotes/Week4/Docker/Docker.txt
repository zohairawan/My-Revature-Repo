*****DOCKER COMMANDS*****
docker images
	Shows you how many images you have
docker ps
	Shows you how many containers(processes) you have running
docker ps -a
	Shows all the containers(processes)
docker pull 'imagename'
	Will pull the specified image but won't run it
docker run 'imagename'
	Runs image as a container
	If you don't have image on your local system it will download it and run the container all with this one command
	It will give the container a random name if not specified
	You can check this in your docker desktop app
	Example:
		docker run nginx
docker run --name 'nameofcontainer' -p 8080:80 'imagename'
	--name specifies the name of a container and prevent docker from giving it a random name
	-p specifies the port, the first is the local port and the second is the image port
	Example:
		docker run --name nginxcontainer -p 8080:80 nginx
		To check to see if this is running go to your browser and type 'localhost:8080'
docker stop 'containername'
	Stops running the specified container
docker rm 'containername'
	Removes specified container
docker image rm 'imagename'
	Removes specified docker image
	Can only remove an image if a container is not running it

*****WORKING WITH POSTGRES IN DOCKER*****
docker run --name zopostgres -e POSTGRES_USER=zo -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=zohair -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
	-e specifies username for postgres
	-e specifies password for postgres
	-p specifies the port numbers
		the first one is the one we want to expose, but since I already created a postgres connection using 5432 this won't work(the one that has projectone in it)
		second one is the underlying port for postgres which default is 5432 
	-d specifies which database to use
