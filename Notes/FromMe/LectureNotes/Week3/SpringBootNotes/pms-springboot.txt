Two types of apps:
1.) To be consumed by end user - End user needs HTML
2.) To be consumed by another app - Data will be sent in the form of JSON to the other app

HTTP methods:
GET - 		get a record			@GetMapping	
POST - 		insert or create		@PostMapping
PUT - 		update a record			@PutMapping
DELETE - 	delete a record			@DeleteMapping

We want to create an app that gives another app these above options

Request ---> Controller ---> DAO ---> Database
Request comes to controller and from there it goes to DAO layer and DAO layer will call DB

Example:
	localhost:8084/product			GET all products
	localhost:8084/product/123		GET a single product Client app can retrieve a single product with specified productId
	localhost:8084/product/Lakme	GET all products matching the productName  Client app can retrieve all products matching productName

@PathVariable - allows you to pass a parameter in the URL
Example:
	@GetMapping("{pId}")
	public Product getProduct(@PathVariable("pId") int productId) {
		Product product = new Product(1, "Lakme", 99, 100);
		return product;
	}
