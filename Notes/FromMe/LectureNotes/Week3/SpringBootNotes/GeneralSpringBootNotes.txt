*****WHAT IS SPRING BOOT?*****
Spring Framework Features:
POJO
Dependency Injection
MVC
REST
Security
Batch
Data
AOP
....

Spring Framework can integrate with other frameworks as well:
	Hibernate
	Struts
	
-Spring Boot is not a replacement for Spring Framework because you are still working
with Spring Framework
-Working with just Spring Framework you need to do a lot of configuration and it can
be a bit tricky
-Spring Boot takes care of a lot of configuration for you
-Developer ---> Spring Boot ---> Spring Framework
-Spring Boot acts as a middleman to help you work with the Spring Framework
-Spring Boot gives you Dependency(JAR files) and configuration that you would 
otherwise have to do yourself
-Main idea of Spring Boot is to give you a production ready application
-The moment you create a Spring Boot project you don't have to do any configuration,
it is runnable and you can deploy it on the server
-Spring Boot provides you an embedded server, which means the application JAR file
which you'll create has an embedded server(Tomcat) inside it
-If you want to make any configuration changes they must be done in the 
'application.properties' file


*****DEPENDENCY INJECTION*****
-Dependency Injection is a design pattern
-Objects depend on other objects
-You want this dependency to be 'loose coupling'
-Example:
	-Laptop has components(Hardrive, RAM, Screen, etc..)
	-Laptop is dependent on these objects
	-But you want to be able to switch out your Hardrive down the line if you want
	 or loose coupling of objects
-Loose coupling can be achieved by having 'dependency injection container' create 
the objects we are
dependent on(dependency)
-We want to inject the dependency(object) inside the class that needs it, which
will be done by some dependency injection container
-Use @Component(above the class) on the object dependency
-Use @AutoWired(above the object) in the class that we need the dependency
-This concept achieves loose coupling as well as another factor, testing
-We should always test each component and this will allow us to test without
effecting one another
-At its core dependency injection:
	Centralizes the creation of concrete objects that your code(client) uses
	Benefits from this include:
		easily switching out the implementation
		easily test the implementation
		able to wrap/manipulate how you want it to instantiate:
			this can be wrapping authentication around it
			adding pre/post processing
			auditing/logging
