Docker Compose
	Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications
	With Compose, you use a YML file to configure your application’s services
	Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration

Using Docker Compose
	Using Compose is basically a three-step process:
		1. Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
		2. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
		3. Run 'docker compose up' and the Docker compose command starts and runs your entire app. You can alternatively run docker-compose up using the docker-compose binary.

docker-compose.yml file
	A docker-compose.yml file may look like this:
		services:
			web:
				image: "mmumshad/simple-webapp"
			database:
				image: "mongodb"
			messaging:
				image: "redis:alpine"
			orchestration:
				image: "ansible"
	This is a very simple version of the docker-compose.yml file and in reality your docker-compose.yml file will be more complicated than this
	
Sample application - voting application
	Summary:
		This is a sample voting application which provides an interface for a user to vote and another interface to show the results
		This sample application is used to show how easy it is to set up an entire application stack consisting of diverse components in Docker
		
	Architecture/Dataflow:
		voting-app
			Web application developed in Python to provide the user with an interface to choose between two options - cat and dog
		in-memory DB
			When you make a selection(cat or dog) the vote is stored in redis
			Redis, in this case, servers as a database in memory
		worker:
			This vote is then processed by the worker
			The worker application takes the new vote and updates the persistent database, which is PostgreSQL
			This application is written in .NET
		db:
			PostgreSQL, in our case, simply has a table with the number of votes for each category
		result-app
			The result of the vote is displayed in a web interface, which is another web application developed in Node.js
			This application reads the results of the votes from the PostgreSQL database and displays it to the user
		
	Components of application:
		voting-app ---> in-memory DB ---> worker ---> db ---> result-app
		(Python)		(Redis)			  (.NET) (PostgreSQL) (Node.js)

Running voting application - using 'run'
	Lets see how we can put this application stack together on a single Docker engine using 'docker run' commands
	Lets assume that all the images of the application are already built and are available on Docker Repository
	
	Starting with the data layer - redis
		We want to run an instance of Redis
			docker run -d --name redis redis
		Now the in-memory DB portion of our app has the appropriate container
		
	Deploying the PostgreSQL database - postgres
		We want to run an instance of PostgreSQL
			docker run -d --name db postgres:9.4
		Now the db portion of our app has the appropriate container
	
	Application services -voting-app
		We want to create an instance of voting-app
			docker run -d --name vote -p 5000:80 voting-app
		Now the voting-app portion of our app has the appropriate container
		This will be the frontend portion of our application where users can cast their vote
		Because this is a web server it has a UI instance running on port 80
		We'll publish that port to 5000 on the host system so we can access it from a browser
		
	Application Services -result-app
		We want to create an instance of result-app
			docker run -d --name result -p 5001:80 result-app
		Now the result-app portion of our app has the appropriate container
		This will display the results to the user
		Because this is a web server it has a UI instance running on port 80
		We'll publish that port to 5001 on the host system so we can access it from a browser
		
	Application Services - worker
		We want to create an instance of worker
			docker run --name worker worker
			
	Encountering an issue
		This seems to be all good, however when you run the app you encounter an issue 'Internal Server Error'
		Problem:
			We have successfully run all the different containers but we haven't actually linked them together
			As in, we haven't told the voting-app to use this particular instance of redis - there could be multiple redis instances running
			We haven't told the worker and the result-app to use this particular instance of PostgreSQL database
			Etc...
			
Links
	Command line option which can be used to link two containers together
	In our case the voting-app is dependent on the redis service when the web server starts
	So we must link the voting-app container to the redis container
		docker run -d --name vote -p 5000:80 --link redis:redis voting-app
			--link <container_name>:<host>
	What it's doing is it creates an entry into the etc/host file on the voting-app container, adding an entry with the host name redis with an internal IP of the redis container
		
	Let's link the remining containers
		docker run -d --name result -p 5001:80 --link db:db result-app
			
	The worker application requires access to both the redis and PostgreSQL database
	So we add two links to the worker application
		One link to link the redis
		The other link to link the PostgreSQL
			docker run --name worker --link db:db --link redis:redis worker
	Note that using links this way is deprecated and may be removed in the future
	This is because newer concepts in Docker Swarm and networking supports better ways of achieving links
				
Running voting application - using 'compose up'
	Lets see how we can put this application stack together on a single Docker engine using 'docker compose up'
	Once we have the 'docker run' commands tested and ready it is easy to generate a docker-compose file
	We start by using a dictionary of container names
		We'll use the same names we used in the 'docker run' commands
		
	docker-compose.yml
		redis:
		db:
		vote:
		result:
		worker:
			Then under each container name we specify which image to use
			
		redis:
			image: redis
		db:
			image: postgres:9.4
		vote:
			image: voting-app
		result:
			image: result-app
		worker:
			image: worker
			The key is the image and the value is the name of the image to use
			
		Next we inspect the commands and see what other options were used
		We published ports so lets move those ports under the respective containers
		redis:
			image: redis
		db:
			image: postgres:9.4
		vote:
			image: voting-app
			ports:
				- 5000:80
		result:
			image: result-app
			ports:
				-5001:80
		worker:
			image: worker
			
		Finally we are left with links
		redis:
			image: redis
		db:
			image: postgres:9.4
		vote:
			image: voting-app
			ports:
				- 5000:80
			links:
				- redis
		result:
			image: result-app
			ports:
				-5001:80
			links:
				- db
		worker:
			image: worker
			links:
				- redis
				- db
	
	Now that we've finished writing our docker-compose file bringing up the stack is simple
	Just run the 'docker compose up' command to bring up the entire application stack
	
Docker compose - build
	In our previous example we assumed all the images were already built
	Out of the 5 images 2 of them are actually already available on Docker Hub(Redis and PostgreSQL)
	The remaining 3 are our own application
	If we would like to instruct docker-compose.yml to run a docker build instead of trying to pull an image we could replace the image line with a build line to specify the location of a directory which contains the application code
	For example we could have a folder called vote which contains all the application code and a Dockerfile
	We can also use the build command to build the two other services from the respective folder
		redis:
			image: redis
		db:
			image: postgres:9.4
		vote:
			build: ./vote
			ports:
				- 5000:80
			links:
				- redis
		result:
			build: ./result
			ports:
				-5001:80
			links:
				- db
		worker:
			build: ./worker
			links:
				- redis
				- db
				
		Now when you run the 'docker compose up' command it will first build the image, give a temporary name for it, and then use those images to run the container using the options you specified before

Docker compose - versions
	Now lets take a look at different versions of docker-compose files
	You might see docker-compose files in different formats at different places
	Docker compose evolved over time and supports a lot more options than it did in the beginning
	
	Version 1
		redis:
			image: redis
		db:
			image: postgres:9.4
		vote:
			image: voting-app
			ports:
				5000:80
			links:
				redis
		
		Version 1 of the docker-compose file had a number of limitations:
			If you wanted to deploy containers on a different network other than the default bridge network, there was no way of specifying that in this version of the file
			If you have a dependency or startup order of some kind, for example your database container must come up first and only then should the voting application be started, there was no way to specify that
			
	Version 2
		The format of the file also changed a little bit
		services
			You no longer specified your stack information directly as you did before, it's all encapsulated in the services section
			You create a property called services in the root of the file and then move all the services underneath that
		version
			You also specify the version of docker-compose that you're using from version 2 and up
		network
			Another difference is with networking
				In Version 1 docker compose attaches all the containers it runs to the default bridge network and then use links to enable communication between the containers as we did before
				With Version 2 docker compose automatically creates a dedicated bridge network for this application and then attaches all containers to that new network
				All containers are then able to communicate to each other using each other's service name
				So you basically don't need to use links in Version 2 of docker compose, you can get rid of all the links you mentioned in Version 1
		depends_on
			Version 2 introduces a depends_on feature
				If you wish to specify a startup order, for example the voting web app is dependent on the redis service so you need to ensure that the redis container is started first and then the voting web app must be started, you can add a depends_on property to the voting app and indicate that it depends on the redis
		
		version 2:
		services:
			redis:
				images: redis
			db:
				image: postgres:9.4
			vote:
				image: voting-app
				ports:
					- 5000:80
				depends_on:
					redis
					
	Version 3
		Similar to version 2 in the structure
		Comes with support for Docker Swarm
		We will see version 3 in much more detail later when we discuss Docker stacks
		
		version 3:
		services:
			redis:
				images: redis
			db:
				image: postgres:9.4
			vote:
				image: voting-app
				ports:
					- 5000:80
					
Docker compose - networks
	In our application so far we've just been deploying all the containers on the default bridge network
	Lets modify the architecture a bit to contain the traffic from the different sources
		For example, we'd like to seperate the user generated traffic from the app's internal traffic
		We create a frontend network dedicated for traffic from users and a backend network dedicated for traffic within the application
		We then connect the user facing app(voting-app and result-app) to the frontend network and all the components to an internal backend network
		The first thing we need to do if we were to use networks is to define the networks we are going to use
			In our case we have 2 networks:
				frontend
				backend
			So create a new property called networks at the root level adjacent to the services and add a map of networks we're planning to use
			Then under each service create a networks property and provide a list of networks that service must be attached to
			
			version 2:
			services:
				redis:
					images: redis
					networks:
						- back-end
				db:
					image: postgres:9.4
					networks:
						- back-end
				vote:
					image: voting-app
					ports:
						- 5000:80
					networks:
						- front-end
						- back-end
				result:
					image: result-app
					ports:
						-5001:80
					networks:
						- front-end
						- back-end
				worker:
					image: worker
					networks:
						- back-end
			networks:
				front-end:
				back-end:
