Running a simple web-app manually(w/o Dockerfile)
	We are going to run a simple web-app using flask
	In order to do this we will have to download some pre-req dependencies which include:
		python
		pip
		flask
	We can do this on our local machine OR we can do this on an ubuntu image
	We will chose to run an ubuntu image and run the simple-web app from there that way we don't have all the dependencies downloaded to our local machine
	
	Running an ubuntu image
		docker run -it --name udemy-simple-web-app -p 5000:5000 ubuntu
		
	Updating your package index
		apt-get update
		
	Installing python
		apt-get install -y python-is-python3
		To ensure python was properly installed run:
			python3
				You should see the python version number as well as putting you in python
				Type exit() to get out of python
		
	Installing pip
		apt-get install python3-pip
		
	Installing flask
		pip install flask
		
	Creating a folder to store the source code
		Inside the running ubuntu container type the commands in the home directory:
			mkdir zohair
			cd zohair
			mkdir simple-web-app
			cd simple-web-app
			
	Copying Source Code
		We have now downloaded all the necessary dependencies onto the ubuntu container
		We now have to add the source code to the container
		Since ubuntu images don't come with any kind of text editors we have to add it using another way
		Get the source code from https://github.com/mmumshad/simple-webapp-flask
		Copy the text inside the app.py file which is:
			import os
			from flask import Flask
			app = Flask(__name__)

			@app.route("/")
			def main():
				return "Welcome!"

			@app.route('/how are you')
			def hello():
				return 'I am good, how about you?'

			if __name__ == "__main__":
				app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
		Go to your container and make sure you're in the container's terminal
		If you want to add text run the command:
			cat > <filename> and hit ENTER
		You will then just have a cursor blinking, this is where you can begin to start writing whatever you want
		When you are done make sure to hit ENTER
			If you don't hit ENTER and the line you're currently on has text and you CTRL+C out of there the last line of text won't be saved
		Press CTRL+C to exit out of the place where you can write text
		If you want to append additional text into the file run the command:
			cat >> <filename>
		
	Starting the web server
		Before running the following command make sure you are in the directory that contains the app.py file
		FLASK_APP=app.py flask run --host=0.0.0.0
