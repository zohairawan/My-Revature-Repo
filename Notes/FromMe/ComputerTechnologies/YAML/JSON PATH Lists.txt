JSON PATH - Lists
	We will get introduced to some of the advanced options available while working with JSON PATHS queries specifically with lists
	
	For example:
		[
			"Apple",
			"Google",
			"Microsoft",
			"Amazon",
			"Facebook",
			"Coca-Cola",
			"Samsung",
			"Disney",
			"Toyota",
			"McDonalds"
		]
		
		Get the 1st element
		$[0]
		
		Get the 4th element
		$[3]
		
		Get the 1st and 4th element
		$[0,3]
		
		Get the 1st to 4th element
		$[0:3]
			Apple, Google, Microsoft
			3rd element in not inclusive
			
		Starting at the 1st get every other element
		$[0:8:2]
			Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Samsung
			The 2 means increment the counter twice before getting the next item, in other words skip/hop over one item
			
		Get the last element
		$[-1] ---> Does not work in certain implementations though
		$[-1:] OR $[-1:0]
			The last element in an array has index -1, second to last is -2, etc...
			
		Get the last 3 elements
		$[-3:]
