What is YAML
	A YAML file is used to represent data - configuration data
	It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted
	
Other Data Structure formats
	XML
	JSON
	
Example files
	XML:
		<Servers>
			<Server>
				<name>Server1</name>
				<owner>John</owner>
				<created>12232012</created>
				<status>active</status>
			</Server>
		</Servers>
		
	JOSN
		{
			Servers: [
				{
					name: Server1,
					owner: John,
					created: 12232012,
					status: active,
				}
			]
		}
	
	YAML
		Servers:
			-	name: Server1
				owner: John
				created: 12232012
				status: active
				
Building Blocks
	Key Value Pair
		Fundamentally, a file written in YAML consists of a set of key-value pairs
		Each pair is written as key: value, where whitespace after the : is optional
		Syntax:
			key: value
		Example:
			Fruit: Apple
			Vegetable: Carrot
			Liquid: Water
			Meat: Chicken
		
	Array/Lists
		In certain circumstances it is necessary to provide multiple values or objects for a single key
		More than one key-value pair can be mapped to a single key
		Example:
			Fruits:
			-	Apple
			-	Orange
			-	Banana
			
			Vegetables:
			-	Carrot
			-	Tomato
			- Cauliflower
			
			The - indicates that it's an element of an array
			
	Dictionary/Map
		A set of properties grouped together under an item
		Syntax:
			Key/Property: Value
		Example:
			Banana:
				Calories: 105
				Fat: 0.4g
				Carbs: 27g
			
			Grapes:
				Calories: 62
				Fat: 0.3g
				Carbs: 16
				
Spaces
	There is a 'parent' and 'child' relationship with data
	A child is represented by being indented further in than the parent
	For example:
		Banana:
			Calories: 105
			Fat: 0.4g
			Carbs: 27g
		Banana is the parent and everything indented below it is the child
	The number of spaces before each property is important in YAML
	Siblings are properties that have the same number of spaces

YAML Advanced
	Key Value/Dictionary/Lists
		Fruits:
			-	Banana:
					Calories: 105
					Fat: 0.4g
					Carbs: 27g
					
			-	Grapes:
					Calories: 62
					Fat: 0.3g
					Carbs: 16
		In this case we have a list of fruits and the elements of the list are banana and grape but each of these elements are further dictionaries containing nutrition information
		
YAML - Notes
	List is an ordered collection
		Fruits:				=/=		Fruits:
			-	Apple					-	Apple
			-	Orange					-	Banana
			-	Banana					-	Orange
	Dictionary is an unordered collection
		Banana:					=		Banana
			Calories: 105					Calories: 105
			Fat: 0.4g						Carbs: 27g
			Carbs: 27g						Fat: 0.4g
